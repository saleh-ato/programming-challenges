'''   Modern cryptography involves code, and code involves coding.
      CryptoHack provides a good opportunity to sharpen your skills.

      Of all modern programming languages, Python 3 stands out as ideal
      for quickly writing cryptographic scripts and attacks.
      
      For more information about why we think Python is so great for this, please see the FAQ.
